BIOEN 468 Lab 7: Filtering with Arduino
FIR coefficients

tonyfu97@uw.edu, Feb 2023

#####################################

The following text file contain the filter coefficients of some FIR fitlers. They are generated with MATLAB's signal processing toolbox. They have already been converted into C-style arrays. Just copy the array you want into your Arduino script.

fs = sampling rate in Hz
cutoff = cutoff frequencies of the filter
dev = deviations/ripples allowed in the passbands and stopband(s).
type = filter type
N = filter length
